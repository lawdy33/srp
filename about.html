            I was born an artist. Never far away from my pencils, colors, markers, and paper, I claimed my birthright all the way up to 2nd grade, when, on the first day at a new school, a little boy pointed at my drawing of a tree and laughed at it. The class followed his lead.  In hindsight, of course, I see that he was my first ‘hater,’ a symbolic representative that what I was offering wasn’t everyone’s cup of tea. And it hurt. I didn’t know at the time that my aversion to the ordinary, mass consciousness ways of looking at things was being ushered within my consciousness, nor did I care one iota.  I was simply a humiliated 7 year old little girl surrounded by new classmates who knew good art when they saw it, and mine didn’t measure up.  I made that little boy right about me and my abilities that day, and, it turns out, many years afterwards. Like most children, whose early emotional wounds, or stories we make up when we neither had the knowledge of nor the understanding of the bigger picture, often end up sending us down trajectories of development that eventually bring us back home to our heart’s calling—even if it’s decades later.

            Childhood wounds, however much power we choose to give them during our lives, pale in comparison to our indomitable spirit and what we’re really made of—the energy of pure unconditional love. But waking up from the dream or our limitations is actually key to eventually living the dream as the authentic self. I can attest to the feeling of freedom that comes following the release of a personal story or belief, knowing we are so much more than the culmination of our culture and conditioning.  And, after professional forays into the arts, academia, and business over the years, I’ve let go of so many of my former roles and societal shoulds, to embrace the joys of simply creating once again. I credit my own uber creative daughter in taking me by the hand just a few short years ago saying “we’re going to Daniel Smith  today so we can get stuff to have an art day!”  After that glorious afternoon with her I was hooked on creative expression once again. And, years later, in the realm of when the student is ready, the teacher appears miracles, my intuitive, brilliant, and technically savvy son showed up to help me create a web site once I was ready to be real. Indeed,  it’s a lesson for the ages.  Unlike struggling your way along a path that’s not meant for you, when you take your hands off the wheel and fully partner with the intuitive voice within, life flows.

            These days for me it’s all about experimenting with paint and art supplies and the messy chaos that occurs when trying new things. And then, often unexpectedly, I’m delighted with what emerges on the canvas.  It’s about opening up to authentic creativity, dropping dogma—personal and cultural--and asking, “what if?” It’s about playing the game from heart, rather than trying to figure it out in my head. Or, when it comes to creating what’s next, inquiring about what’s possible when I ignore an accepted assumption or rule, and instead, I establish a relationship between two unexpected elements? What old paradigms will bust open? What new energy will be revealed? This is the true magic of creativity and all of us can tap into this power, not only people who paint, write, sing, sculpt or dance for a living.  Imagine the possibilities if each one of us drops a fear or judgment and reclaims a piece of our heart, then decides to express that love in our own daily living? Explosions of joy would ensue. That’s a vision I can stand for.

            As my wonderful loving husband says, “Just go out there and be the beautiful you.” How great is that? I think I’ll take him up on his advice. You can too!
