          <p>Although each of us is born longing for home, the home we are searching for never leave us, no matter what locale or structure we inhabit. We are home when we are centered in our hearts, giving and receiving the love that we are.
          </p>
          <p>When it comes to our homes, apartments, cabins, or offices, however, few of us defer to this deep truth when it comes to adorning our spaces. Rather, we have bought in hook, line, and sinker to the not so subtle messages bombarding us from the building and design industries that keep us chasing new colors, styles, upgrades, and conveniences that emerge each season. Is it fun to change color schemes in the bedroom? Absolutely! Will a transformative kitchen remodel enable you to fulfill your passion for cooking and entertaining? You bet it can. Will the move to a bigger house, tiny house, the suburbs, the beach, the woods, or another state or country turn out to be the perfect spot for you? Indeed, you may discover a perfect habitat, or 2 or 5 that facilitates the most loving and joyful existence you can imagine. Congratulations and keep on keeping on. You’re already Soulspacing!
          </p>
          <h3>A Deeper Approach</h3>
          <p>But many people aren’t experiencing their homes and offices as the sanctuaries they can be. They’re struggling with too much stuff. Or, they’re perceiving that their spaces aren’t good enough, whether it’s size or content. Fortunately, our culture has a grand solution to this dilemma—buy yourself some joy and happiness! Shop for the latest trends and fashions. You deserve it. Show your friends and visitors your true style. Make that living room, bedroom, or bathroom pop with new color. Rearrange that furniture, or, better yet, buy that one piece that “they” promise will transform the space.
          </p>
          <p>Again, I’m not demeaning the intentional and often delightful changes we engage with when making changes in our habitats, but instead, drawing attention to the mindless assumptions and conditioned reactions that go unexamined when making these shifts.
          </p>
          <p>Like everything in our society, things are moving at breakneck speed in our personal lives. Every facet of our culture, from politics, to the economy, to education and beyond is being called to question their sacred cows and assumptions.  We are being called to look within as never before. As we awaken to the magnificence of who we are within, our external environments follow suit—albeit reluctantly. The old falls away to make room for the new. It’s a universal principle, but it also invites fear and clenching onto former ways of being.
          </p>
          <p>But our former ways of being aren’t working as evidenced by the popularity of new methods of coping with our dysfunction. You can’t find a lifestyle magazine these days without a a feature article about minimizing, decluttering, tiny home design, organizing tricks, or feng shui. We are slowly recognizing the illusion of buying ourselves happy—an egoic fear, fueled by a sense of lack within.  We are searching for love in all the wrong places and we want out of the madness.
          </p>
          <h3>Soulspacing, Self Love and Our Surroundings
          </h3>
          <p>Although I developed the concept of Soulspacing over 25 years ago, based on an elderly woman’s interior design story gone wrong, I wouldn’t understand the real breadth of the approach till many years after I heard that tale—until I experienced challenging my own egoic assumptions and limiting stories.
          </p>
          <p>MORE STORY INSERTED HERE (in process)
          </p>
          <p>In Soulspacing we focus on the indomitable spirit and soul consciousness of the space dweller rather than the volume of or excess items in the space. Clearing low vibratory thoughts and dysfunctional energy, replacing them with higher truth and highlighting the person’s dreams and intentions for their life, takes first priority. I’m often asked, why clearing bags of excess doesn’t come first as in most other popular commercial programs or approaches.
          </p>
          <p>It’s true, you can get a lot of visible mileage by bringing a dozen bags of old clothes and household items to Goodwill on the first day. Bravo! In my experience with clients, however, I am not nearly as interested in them trying to impress me by letting go of large amounts of stuff while I’m in their presence than I am in their capacity to do so on their own. This takes a whole new consciousness.
